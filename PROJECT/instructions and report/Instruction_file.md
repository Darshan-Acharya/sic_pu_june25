$Prelimary Instruction for the usage of the data analytics project on the recent trend change on the engineering branch selection 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Installation of the all the necessary libraries like matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, random, pandas modules with the latest version of the python

2. The data_aquisition.py file will randomly generate the data of seven branches enrollment by default from 2005 - 2024 and save the data in the format of .csv(comma separated values) for the better data analyzation from the pandas libraries

3. the data_implementation.py file will have some function for the respective data representation which then will help the data_visualization.py file to access the necessary methods as user entered

4. the final file  data_visualization.py will have the menu which will access the user-preferred methods and does the necessary operation for the user-input while not using any UI(user-inetrface) or GUI(graphical user interface) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: this Project is for the understanding of the basic fluctuation that can happen in the trend of choosing the branch in engineering. Here we are not using the actual data instead we generated  the random data using python modules so, the data is in this project is not related to any virtual data, utilize this project for the knowledge purpose.

Thank you for your time in my instruction set now you can go through the Report for further information regarding the project then after go through the code for the visual representation of the data

THANK YOU ONE AND ALL :)
